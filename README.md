# Payment Service Refactoring

## Refactoring Summary

### Steps Taken
1. Refactored the code to make it testable:
   - Moved configuration logic to its own class.
   - Added interfaces for repositories.
   - Used dependency injection for flexibility.
2. Added unit tests for PaymentService to cover main payment scenarios:
   - Tests use Moq to mock repositories and services, allowing for isolated and deterministic unit tests.
   - AutoFixture is used to generate test data, reducing boilerplate.
3. Improved the structure and design:
   - Split code into domain, application, and infrastructure layers.
   - Created a domain model for transactions.
   - Moved validation logic into dedicated classes and the Account entity.
   - Used factories and a resolver for transaction creation and selection.
   - Added domain services for core business logic.

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear job (e.g., Account, PaymentService, Factories, Validators).
- **Open/Closed**: Factories and resolver make it easy to add new payment types without changing existing code.
- **Liskov Substitution**: Interfaces and base types are used correctly.
- **Interface Segregation**: Interfaces are focused and simple.
- **Dependency Inversion**: Dependencies are injected, making the code easier to test and maintain.

### DDD Compliance
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Domain logic is kept separate from infrastructure and application concerns.
2. **Domain Model**: Account, TransferTransaction, and related entities encapsulate business logic (e.g., validation, payment scheme checks).
3. **Factories**: IPaymentTransactionFactory and its implementations (BacsTransactionFactory, etc.) handle transaction creation.
4. **Services**: PaymentService coordinates the payment process, delegating to domain services and factories.

### Result
The payment service is now easier to test, maintain, and extend. The design follows SOLID and DDD principles in a practical way, with clear separation of responsibilities and improved code quality.

## Future Improvements

While the current implementation updates account balances, a real-world system would require the following features:

- Implement destination account handling for transfers (I created the structure but didn't want to change the core logic of the transfer without further discussion).
- Add robust exception handling to cover edge cases.
- Enclose payment transactions within a transaction scope to ensure atomicity.
- Add a notification service to inform users of payment status and apply the outbox pattern for reliable message delivery.
- Create ledger entries for each transaction.
- Add audit logs to track all changes.
- Add request validation to prevent invalid operations.
- Calculate and charge transaction fees.
- Support multiple currencies.
